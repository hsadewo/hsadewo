## Hi, I am Herry Sadewo. You can call me Dewo ðŸ‘‹
With over 29 years of extensive experience as a professional in the Petrochemical industry (Olefins Plant), I have developed a strong track record in pre-commissioning, commissioning, startup, shutdown, and plant operations of both Naphtha and Ethane Crackers. My role consistently emphasizes delivering high-quality products that surpass customer expectations while supporting the company in meeting production and revenue targets.

I bring proven leadership in managing and inspiring a diverse, multi-disciplinary workforce, navigating complex cultural and linguistic backgrounds. My flexibility, open-minded approach, and natural leadership qualities enable me to excel under pressure and drive team success.
